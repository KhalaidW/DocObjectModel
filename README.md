## Ship Battle

# currently all that ship battles has is 2 grids with a ship yard where the ships sit before being place. the user is able to click and drage a ship from the shipyard onto the player field. unfortunately that is all there is to offer for the application currently but as a fun little easter egg the user can click on the duck and cause it to move left and right.
